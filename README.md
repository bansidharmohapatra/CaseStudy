# Lending Club Case Study

Outline a brief description of your project.
------------------------------------------
Consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

In this case study, we will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.


## Table of Contents

*	The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

* Technologies Used:- 

	Data Cleaning

	Data Derivation and metadata generation.

* Various analysis reports

	Univariate Analysis

	Segmented Univariate Analysis

	Bivariate Analysis

* [Conclusions]

Lending Club Case study helps to find the risk factors and  recommends to sanction loan or not.

Some other following Recommendations for better predictions  

* Recommendations:

Enhanced Risk Management: Lending Club should continue to refine its risk assessment models to improve loan performance and reduce default rates. Investing in advanced analytics and machine learning could provide more accurate predictions and better risk mitigation.

Regulatory Compliance: As the company grows, it must proactively address regulatory challenges and ensure compliance with evolving financial regulations. Engaging with regulators and participating in industry forums could help shape favorable policies and avoid legal pitfalls.

Diversification of Offerings: To maintain competitive advantage, Lending Club might explore diversifying its product offerings beyond personal loans. Expanding into other financial services, such as small business loans or investment products, could attract a broader customer base and increase revenue streams.

Customer Experience Improvement: Continuous enhancement of the user experience, both for borrowers and investors, will be crucial for sustaining growth. Investing in user-friendly technologies and providing exceptional customer support can help retain and attract customers
